# GasPriceDecomp
Code used in thesis for MSc Sustainable Energy Futures @ImperialCollegeLondon

This jupyter notebook is the backbone of the thesis. It allows testing assumptions on datasets used, transforming them in order to be used in a Vector Auto Regressive model (VAR).

This model is then analysed to understand influences of various factors over the natural gas price in the UK (NBP).
